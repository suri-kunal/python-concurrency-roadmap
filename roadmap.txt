üöÄ Dangerous Quickstart Roadmap: Iterators, Generators, Asyncio, Concurrency
Overarching Principles for Each Step:

Project-First: Every phase has you ship, break, and fix something real.

Mandatory Failure: For every main project, induce bugs and failure conditions. Debug and fix.

Mentor as Chaos Agent: The mentor‚Äôs job is not to answer questions, but to poke holes, inject failures, and force robust solutions.

Tooling Throughout: Logging, profiling, and monitoring are part of every deliverable. No exceptions.

Phase 0: Setup and Environment (0.5 Day)

Prepare Python 3.10+ environment.

Install:
aiohttp, pytest, pytest-asyncio, memory_profiler, tracemalloc, cProfile

Check: Basic logging, debugging, and profiling works. Set up minimal Dockerfile for later.

Phase 1: Iterators & Generators (2 Days)
Day 1:

Learn:
Understand __iter__, __next__, and StopIteration.
Build simple iterators/generators from scratch.
Read intro to generator.pdf (first few slides only, not the full deck).

Project:
Write a generator-based pipeline to parse a multi-GB log or CSV and compute aggregates.

Deliverable:
Memory/profile prove that you NEVER load all data at once.

Break:
Feed in malformed data; make sure errors get logged, not crash the pipeline.
Your mentor must purposely break the parser logic at least once and make you refactor for robustness.

Day 2:

Challenge:
Add a context manager using @contextmanager to the pipeline (e.g., for file/resource management).

Deliverable:
Show error-safe resource cleanup (e.g., file always closed, even if error mid-pipeline).

Phase 2: Asyncio ‚Äî Async/Await, Modern I/O (4 Days)
Day 3-4:

Learn:
Core concepts: async def, await, asyncio.run, event loop basics.
Build a simple async function that prints asynchronously (‚Äúhello, world‚Äù spaced out).

Project:
Write a concurrent web/URL scraper using aiohttp.
Scrapes 50-100 URLs concurrently and parses, logs result.
Uses semaphore for rate-limiting (N parallel requests).
Handles timeout & exception robustly.

Deliverable:
Comparison of async vs. sync scraping speed.

Break:
Insert time.sleep() (aka blocking) in an async handler‚Äîprove whole process freezes, then refactor to fix.
Introduce dead/slow URLs; ensure scraper does not hang indefinitely.

Mentor Action:
Randomly kill a task or corrupt a response. You must recover gracefully and log what happened.

Day 5:

Add:
Explicit structured logging (log task IDs, errors, timing).

Challenge:
Your mentor adds a ‚Äúfailing‚Äù endpoint that always error 500‚Äôs or times out. Build resilience.

Day 6:

Unit testing:
Write at least 2 pytest-asyncio tests to ensure scraper never hangs on dead endpoints.

Phase 3: Multiprocessing and Thread Integration (3 Days)
Day 7:

Learn:
Use multiprocessing.Pool and/or Process to parallelize a CPU-heavy function (math calc, image resize, CPU part of previous project).

Project:
Take a function from the log/CSV parser or one step of scraping and run via multiprocessing.

Deliverable:
Prove multi-core performance with system monitor (e.g., htop).

Break:
Pass unpicklable data (expect and handle errors).
Intentionally make a worker crash mid-job; ensure main code logs and handles.

Day 8:

Threading Interop:
Integrate a blocking function into your async project using asyncio.to_thread or run_in_executor().

Challenge:
Share mutable state between threads and create (then fix) a race condition, using threading primitives.

Phase 4: Capstone Integration & Resilience (3 Days)
Day 9-10:

Project:
Capstone: Choose between
Async harvester: Collects from APIs/scrapes/streams, aggregates, and pushes to disk or DB.
Async microservice: Handles concurrent HTTP/API requests via FastAPI/Sanic/AIOHTTP.
Capstone must include:
Async data fetching
Multiprocessing/CPU step
Structured logging and error handling
Profiled under simulated load

Failure:
You and your mentor script at least three failure scenarios (network, bad data, task crash).
You must detect, recover, and log all.

Day 11:

Optional/Advanced:
Containerize in Docker.
Add a /healthz endpoint.
Write a ‚Äúpostmortem‚Äù doc: What broke during build/test? How did you debug/fix? What will you watch for in the future?

Ongoing (and Only-On-Demand):

Mentor Instructions

Don‚Äôt over-explain.

Play ‚Äúchaos monkey‚Äù: break, overwhelm, or change requirements unpredictably.

Make the learner debug under pressure.

For each main project: After it ‚Äúworks,‚Äù inject 1-2 failure conditions (bad data, deadlock, network drop, etc.) and demand not just a fix, but a logged, testable re-fix.

Final Advice
You should be delivering, debugging, and breaking every single day. If you‚Äôre not stuck or frustrated, it‚Äôs not hard enough. At the end, you won‚Äôt just know concurrency and async in Python‚Äîyou‚Äôll have the scars, and the code, to prove it.

Good luck. Bring the pain. Become dangerous.
