Here’s a README.md that doesn’t waste time or hide the pain. This sets the tone for anyone who lands on your repo—they’ll know you’re not just following tutorials, you’re building real, breakable, production-grade Python.

# Dangerous Python Concurrency Roadmap

**This repo is not a tutorial. It’s a war zone.**

A project-first, failure-driven journey through Python iterators, generators, asyncio, and multiprocessing. Inspired by the “Dangerous Quickstart Roadmap,” this repo documents every phase, every bug, and every scar earned while building robust, production-grade concurrent systems in Python.

## What’s Inside

- **Phase 0:** Environment setup, tooling, and containerization. No excuses.
- **Phase 1:** Iterators & generators—streaming, parsing, and error-proofing real data.
- **Phase 2:** Asyncio—concurrent scraping, robust error handling, and chaos injection.
- **Phase 3:** Multiprocessing & threading—CPU-bound work, race conditions, and recovery.
- **Phase 4:** Capstone—integrated, profiled, and failure-resilient async microservice or harvester.

## Principles

- **Project-First:** Every phase ships real, working code.
- **Mandatory Failure:** Every project is broken on purpose, then fixed and documented.
- **Chaos Agent:** Requirements change, bugs are injected, and nothing is ever “done” until it survives sabotage.
- **Tooling:** Logging, profiling, and monitoring are non-negotiable.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Follow the roadmap in [`roadmap.txt`](iterator_roadmap.txt).
3. Run the code, break it, fix it, and document what you learned.
4. Don’t skip the Dockerfile, the tests, or the postmortems.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) or your preferred environment manager
- See `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for dependencies

## Roadmap

See [`roadmap.txt`](roadmap.txt) for the full, brutal breakdown.
