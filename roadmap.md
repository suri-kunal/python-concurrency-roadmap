# ðŸš€ Deep Execution Roadmap: Fluent Python Control Flow (Part IV) - Conservative Hourly Chunks

**Target Book:** Fluent Python, 2nd Edition by Luciano Ramalho
**Part IV Focus:** Control Flow (Chapters 17-21)
**Estimated Total Time:** Approx. 57-60 focused hours (adjust based on individual pace)

**Overarching Principles (Your Daily Mantra):**

1.  **"Who Controls the Flow?":** For every construct (loops, generators, `with`, `async`), be able to trace the transfer of execution control. Diagram it if necessary.
2.  **Master Transitions:** Understand the shift from eager to lazy (e.g., `for` loop to generator), sync to async (`yield` to `await`), imperative to declarative (`if/else` to `match`).
3.  **Build, Break, Debug, Document:** Every concept requires code. Every piece of code must be intentionally broken. Every break must be debugged. Every insight must be documented (even brief notes).
4.  **Explain the "Why Not":** For every pattern or feature, understand why alternative approaches are less suitable for a given problem. This builds design intuition.
5.  **Tooling is Non-Negotiable:** Profilers, debuggers, linters, and structured logging are part of the craft, not afterthoughts.

## Phase 0: Foundational Mindset & Setup (Approx. 2 Hours Total)

* **Chunk 0.1 (Focus: 45-60 mins): Deconstructing "Control Flow" & Personal Baseline**
    * **Learn:** Re-read the Introduction to Part IV in "Fluent Python" (p. 591 in 2nd Ed.). Contrast the book's definition/scope of "Control Flow" with traditional `if/else/for/while`.
    * **Task:** Document your *current* understanding of these terms from the book's Part IV TOC: Iterators, Generators, Context Managers, `match`, `else` (in loops/try), and the basic idea of Python concurrency (Threads, Processes, Asyncio, GIL). This is your diagnostic.
    * **Deliverable:** Your "current understanding" document. Share with your mentor.
    * **Mentor Action:** Review the baseline. Identify the 2-3 biggest conceptual gaps. This is where you'll apply the most pressure.
* **Chunk 0.2 (Focus: 30-45 mins): Environment Check & Basic Tooling**
    * **Task:** Verify your Python 3.10+ environment. Install: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `memory_profiler`, `tracemalloc`, `cProfile`, `httpx`, `tqdm`, `curio` (for later comparison).
    * **Task:** Write a "hello world" script. Run it with `python -m cProfile your_script.py`. Understand the basic output. Write a *minimal* script that uses `logging` (basic config, log one message) and another for `memory_profiler` (profile a function creating a small list).
    * **Deliverable:** Environment confirmed. Brief notes on `cProfile`, `logging`, and `memory_profiler` basic usage.

## Phase 1: Iteration Mastery & Contextual Power (Chapters 17 & 18) (Target: ~20 Chunks)

**Core Objective:** Master Python's iteration model not just as a way to loop, but as a foundation for data pipelines, lazy evaluation, and understanding how Python *actually* moves through your code.

### Chapter 17: Iterators, Generators, and Classic Coroutines

* **Chunk 1.1 (1 hr): The `for` Loop Deconstructed: The Iterator Protocol**
    * **Learn (FP Ch 17):** "A Sequence of Words," "Why Sequences Are Iterable: The iter Function."
    * **Task:** Manually iterate over `s = 'XYZ'` using `it = iter(s)` and a `while True` loop with `try/except StopIteration` around `val = next(it)`.
    * **Deliverable:** Working manual loop. Diagram the calls: `iter()` -> `s.__iter__()` -> `iterator_obj`, then `next(it)` -> `iterator_obj.__next__()`.
    * **Break-It:** What happens if `s` is empty? If `__iter__` is missing? If `__next__` doesn't raise `StopIteration`?
* **Chunk 1.2 (1 hr): Classic Iterator: `Sentence` & `SentenceIterator` - Part 1**
    * **Learn (FP Ch 17):** "Sentence Take #2: A Classic Iterator" (Ex 17-4). Focus on the `Sentence` class first.
    * **Project:** Implement *only* the `Sentence` class as in Ex 17-4. Its `__iter__` should `return SentenceIterator(self.words)`.
    * **Deliverable:** `Sentence` class code.
* **Chunk 1.3 (1 hr): Classic Iterator: `Sentence` & `SentenceIterator` - Part 2**
    * **Project:** Implement the `SentenceIterator` class (Ex 17-4) with `__init__`, `__next__`, and `__iter__` returning `self`. Test full iteration.
    * **Deliverable:** Complete, working `Sentence` and `SentenceIterator`.
    * **Break-It:** Modify `SentenceIterator.__iter__` to return a *new* `SentenceIterator(self.words)`. What happens? Why is returning `self` the correct iterator pattern?

    * **Learn (FP Ch 17):** "Donâ€™t Make the Iterable an Iterator for Itself."
    * **Project:** Modify your `Sentence` class to include the `__next__` method directly and have `__iter__` return `self`.
    * **Task:** Try iterating over a `Sentence` instance *twice* in a row (two separate `for` loops). What happens?
    * **Deliverable:** Modified `Sentence` and a clear explanation of why this shared state is problematic for reusable iteration.
* **Chunk 1.5 (1 hr): Generators: `yield` and the Compiler's Magic**

* **Chunk 1.11 (1 hr): `yield from`: Basic Delegation**
    * **Learn (FP Ch 17):** "Subgenerators with `yield from`" (up to Ex 17-25).
    * **Project:** Implement Ex 17-25 (simple `gen` and `sub_gen`). Explain how `yield from` changes the flow compared to a manual `for item in sub_gen: yield item`.

* **Chunk 1.12 (1 hr): Project - Log Processing Pipeline with `itertools` & `yield from`**
    * **Project:**
        * **Input:** Generator yielding log lines.

            2.  `extract_messages(error_lines_gen)`: A generator function using `yield` to parse and return only the message part.
            3.  `main_pipeline(filename)`: Uses `yield from filter_errors(stream_log_lines(filename))` and then `yield from extract_messages(...)`.
        * Iterate through `main_pipeline` and print results.
    * **Deliverable:** Log pipeline script.
* **Chunk 1.13 (1 hr): Classic Coroutines - Conceptual Introduction**
    * **Learn (FP Ch 17):** "Classic Coroutines", "Example: Coroutine to Compute a Running Average" (Ex 17-37, 17-38). Focus on `.send()`, priming, and how state is maintained.

    * **Deliverable:** Working `averager()`. Notes: "How is this different from a regular generator used for iteration?"
    * **Mentor Action (Phase 1 Review):** Review iterator/generator distinction, lazy evaluation benefits, `itertools` usage, `yield from` purpose. Provide a complex data transformation task and ask them to solve it with a clean `itertools` and/or generator pipeline. Stress test their Log Processor with diverse bad data. Ensure they understand the *state suspension/resumption* model of generators.

    * **Project:** Implement exception-handling `looking_glass()` (Ex 18-7).
    * **Deliverable:** Robust `looking_glass()`.
    * **Break-It:** Remove `finally`. What happens if an unhandled error occurs in `with`? Is `sys.stdout.write` restored?

    * **Project (Command Parser v2):** `parse_cmd(cmd: dict)` (e.g., `{"type": "DRAW", "shape": "CIRCLE", "params": [10,20,5]}`). Use mapping patterns. Add guards (e.g., `params` length).
    * **Deliverable:** Enhanced parser.
* **Chunk 1.20 (1 hr): `else` in `for` and `try` Statements**
    * **Learn (FP Ch 18):** "Do This, Then That: `else` Blocks Beyond `if`."
    * **Project:** 1. `for/break/else` to find an item. 2. `try/except/else` for a risky operation where `else` runs on success.
    * **Deliverable:** Scripts. Explain precisely when `else` runs.
    * **Mentor Action (Phase 1 End):** Provide a moderately complex, nested data structure (list of dicts of lists). Require `match/case` to extract and transform specific data elements, using captures and guards. Review all Phase 1 deliverables for conceptual clarity.
